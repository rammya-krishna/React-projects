Emmet:
	Emmet is a powerful toolkit  tool for web developers, it provides shortcuts and abbreviations for writing HTML and CSS code quickly and efficiently 
 and with fewer keystrokes,ultimately improving productivity and reducing development time

Library and Framework:
  Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.

  A library is a collection of reusable code modules or functions that can be used by other software.
  Developers have more control over the flow of their application when using libraries because they can choose which functions or classes to use 
  and how to integrate them into their code.

  A framework is a more comprehensive structure that provides a foundation for building an entire application. 
  It dictates the overall architecture and flow of the application.
  Frameworks usually provide a range of functionalities beyond what libraries offer, including tools for handling routing, database interactions, authentication, and more.

CDN:
	A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers strategically placed in various data centers across the globe. 
 The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver web content more efficiently to users by reducing latency, faster Content Delivery ,
 improving website performance, and enhancing overall user experience.

React known as React:
	It "reacts" quickly to changes without reloading the whole page.
	It uses the virtual DOM to efficiently update parts of a webpage.
	Itâ€™s built around components that "react" and update.
	When data changes, React compares the virtual DOM with the previous version, calculates the most efficient way to update the actual DOM, and applies the necessary changes.

crossorigin in script tag:
	The crossorigin attribute, indicating that the browser should fetch the script without sending any credentials or with user credential.
	The crossorigin attribute helps mitigate security risks associated with loading resources from different origins, 
 particularly in the context of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies implemented by browsers to protect against certain types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).

React and ReactDOM :
 React is the core library for building user interfaces in JavaScript, providing features for creating components, managing state, and handling component lifecycles. 
 ReactDOM, is a package that provides bindings between React and the DOM, allowing React components to be rendered into the browser and interact with the web page's DOM.
 
react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN:

react.development.js: This file is meant for development purposes. It includes additional warnings, error messages, and debugging features to aid developers during 
the development process. It is larger in size compared to the production version because of the additional development tools and checks it contains.
react.production.js: This file is optimized for production use. It does not include the extra development warnings, debugging features, or error messages present 
in the development version. It is smaller in size and optimized for performance.

async and defer:
	async allows scripts to be executed as soon as they're downloaded, while defer refers execution until after the HTML parsing is complete.
